## Introduction<br>
In this project, we are attempting to train yolov5 model to detect NFL helmets from gameplay footages. The dataset set that is used is from a kaggle competition

## Other notebooks that are used<br>
As the dataset resides in Kaggle, I have utilized kaggle notebooks for data preparation and training as they have direct access to the dataset
